# Deployment — the robot Pi

The robot's compute is a Raspberry Pi, hostname `raspi`, user `delivery`,
running **ROS 2 Jazzy** installed natively at `/opt/ros/jazzy`. The repo is
cloned at `~/delivery-robo`.

## Connecting

```sh
ssh delivery@raspi.local     # mDNS; use the IP if .local doesn't resolve
```

(Ask a team member for the password / current WiFi. The Pi joins WiFi via
`wpa_supplicant.conf` in the home directory.)

## What runs at boot

`deployment/startup.sh`, run as a systemd service (`robot.service`). On every
start it:

1. `git fetch` + fast-forward to `origin/main` (20 s timeout — skipped when
   offline, refused if someone edited files directly on the Pi so local
   changes are never clobbered);
2. rebuilds `ros2_ws` with colcon **only if** the repo moved or there is no
   install yet (build failure falls back to the previous install);
3. reads `deployment/robot_config.yaml` and launches
   `ros2 launch my_bringup master_launch.py mode:=<mode>`.

So the normal deploy flow is: **merge to `main`, then reboot the robot** (or
`sudo systemctl restart robot.service`). No hand-building on the Pi.

## Robot config (`deployment/robot_config.yaml`)

```yaml
mode: teleop        # teleop | autonomous
robot_id: robo-1    # name shown on the robo-web dashboard
api_url: https://robo-web-ebon.vercel.app   # robo-web base URL (no trailing slash)
```

- `teleop` — wired joystick: `joy_node` + `joystick_control/joystick_node`
  (the setup verified working on the Pi).
- `autonomous` — sensor stack: RTK GPS + NTRIP (`ublox_dgnss`), IMU.

The committed file is the default for every Pi. To change the mode on one
robot without a git commit (a local edit to a tracked file would block the
boot-time `git pull`), copy it to `deployment/robot_config.local.yaml`
(gitignored) — that file wins when present. `ROBOT_CONFIG=/path/to.yaml`
overrides both. Unknown/missing mode falls back to `teleop`.

The same switch works by hand:
`ros2 launch my_bringup master_launch.py mode:=autonomous`.

- `robot_id` / `api_url` — identity and endpoint for the status heartbeat
  (see below). Fill in `api_url` with the Vercel URL of `../robo-web`.

Note: the ros2_control drive stack (`launch_real_robot.launch.py` in `sim/`)
is still launched manually.

## Status heartbeat (robo-web)

The robot reports itself to the `robo-web` dashboard (separate repo,
`../robo-web`, deployed on Vercel) so nobody has to hunt for IPs at a demo.
Two things send it:

1. **`startup.sh`** fires a fire-and-forget `curl -m 5` POST at the very top
   (`state: booting`, `stage: startup.sh`) and again right before the launch
   (`stage: launching`) — so the robot shows up on the dashboard seconds after
   power-on, long before ROS is up. Unreachable API = 5 s lost, nothing else.
2. **`my_bringup/heartbeat_node`** (`ros2_ws/src/my_bringup/my_bringup/heartbeat_node.py`),
   started by `master_launch.py` in every mode with `respawn=True`. Every
   `interval_s` (5 s) it POSTs a full status; network errors are logged
   (throttled to one warning / 30 s) and never crash the node.
   `state` is `booting` until the node has been up one interval and sees at
   least one other ROS node, then it becomes the mode (`teleop`/`autonomous`).

By hand:

```sh
ros2 run my_bringup heartbeat_node --ros-args -p api_url:=https://x.vercel.app -p robot_id:=robo-1
ros2 launch my_bringup master_launch.py mode:=teleop robot_id:=robo-1 api_url:=https://x.vercel.app
```

### API contract

- `POST <api_url>/api/heartbeat` — JSON body; the server upserts the robot by
  `id` and stamps `last_seen`. All fields except `id` are optional:

  ```json
  {
    "id": "robo-1",
    "state": "booting | teleop | autonomous",
    "mode": "teleop",
    "stage": "startup.sh | launching | ros",
    "hostname": "raspi",
    "ips": ["10.0.0.12"],
    "uptime_s": 83.4,
    "git_sha": "0356c3e",
    "ros_distro": "jazzy",
    "ros_nodes": ["joy_node", "control_node"],
    "ros_topics": ["/joy", "/cmd_vel"],
    "cpu_temp_c": 51.0,
    "load_avg": [0.5, 0.4, 0.3],
    "last_joy_age_s": 0.3,
    "last_cmd_vel": {"linear_x": 0.2, "angular_z": 0.0},
    "heartbeat_seq": 42,
    "ts": 1787943000.0
  }
  ```

- `POST <api_url>/api/status` — `{"id": "robo-1", "state": "dead"}`; used by the
  dashboard itself to mark a robot dead after 20 s without a heartbeat
  (Vercel has no free long-running timers, so the browser does it).
- `GET <api_url>/api/robots` — list of every known robot with its last
  payload and `last_seen`.

## Installing / re-wiring the service on the Pi

```sh
cd ~/delivery-robo && git pull
chmod +x deployment/startup.sh
sudo cp deployment/robot.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now robot.service
```

Checking on it:

```sh
systemctl status robot.service          # running? enabled?
systemctl is-enabled robot.service      # "enabled" = starts on boot
journalctl -u robot.service -f          # live logs (launch output goes here)
```

## History

The script that was found running on the Pi (uncommitted, ~/startup.sh)
was:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source ~/delivery-robo/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch my_bringup master_launch.py
# ros2 run joystick_control joystick_node &
#ros2 run joy joy_node &
```

`deployment/startup.sh` supersedes it (same launch, plus pull-and-rebuild).
When switching to the service, remove the old wiring for `~/startup.sh` so it
doesn't start twice.

## Pi setup notes (not yet automated)

Things the Pi needs that no script installs yet — verify when reimaging:

- pip: `adafruit-circuitpython-bno08x` (+ Blinka `board`/`busio`) for the IMU;
  `pyserial` for the encoder node
- apt/ROS: `ublox_dgnss` (+ ntrip client), `twist_mux`, `ros2_control` stack
- user groups: `dialout` (serial), `i2c`
- the `serial` package must be built with
  `colcon build --packages-select serial --cmake-args -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON`
- `rplidar_sdk` is checked out at `~/rplidar_sdk` (lidar not yet wired into
  any launch)
- stray copies exist in the home dir (`~/relivery-robo-old`, a loose
  `~/build`/`~/install`) — do not source those by accident

## WiFi: hotspot first, wustl-guest fallback

`deployment/wifi/` sets wlan0 up with `wpa_supplicant@wlan0` (priority-ordered
SSIDs) + `systemd-networkd` DHCP. The hotspot has `priority=10`, `wustl-guest-2.0`
`priority=1` (lab wifi `wurc5` at 5), so the Pi joins the hotspot whenever it's in range and drops to
wustl-guest otherwise (and switches back when the hotspot returns). One-time
install on the Pi:

```sh
HOTSPOT_SSID='<ssid>' HOTSPOT_PSK='<password>' sudo -E deployment/wifi/install.sh
```
